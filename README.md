# Description

I have used `React` for a few years and I have some familiarity with `TypeScript`
but this is my first attempt at using them together.

This little app lists GitHub repos along with some traffic details.

> Currently, this app only displays _my_ GitHub repos.
> The next step is to turn it into a GitHub OAuth App so that anybody can authorize
> it to display _their_ GitHub repos.
